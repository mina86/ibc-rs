/// header `Hf'` at `Sf.height` and if it is different than the `Hf` in the
/// event for the client update (the one that has generated `Sf` on chain),
/// then the two headers are included in the evidence and submitted. Note
/// that in this case the headers are different but have the same height.
///
/// 2 - BFT time violation for unavailable header (a.k.a. Future Lunatic
/// Attack or FLA):
/// Some header with a height that is higher than the latest height on A has
/// been accepted and a consensus state was created on B. Note that this
/// implies that the timestamp of this header must be within the
/// `clock_drift` of the client. Assume the client on B has been updated
/// with `h2`(not present on/ produced by chain A) and it has a timestamp of
/// `t2` that is at most `clock_drift` in the future. Then the latest header
/// from A is fetched, let it be `h1`, with a timestamp of `t1`. If `t1 >=
/// t2` then evidence of misbehavior is submitted to A.
///
/// 3 - BFT time violation for existing headers:
/// Ensure that consensus state times are monotonically increasing with
/// height.
